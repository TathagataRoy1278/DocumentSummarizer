minmax seems to be giving very high pearson scores so switched to avg, but uaing either shouldnt be a problem

------------------------------
The Base process is : 

i tokenize the text of the article into sentences and save the title of the webpage

Then loop through each tokenized sentence and calculate the pearson score of each sentence vs the title sentence, if the score
is greater than a specific value(base = 0.5) then add it to the summary.

The rating of this working is 6/10

The modified Processes:

1. Cummulative addition (tested)

As i loop through the sentences if one has a high correlation score then after adding it to the summary, the title vector is 
modified by adding that sentence vector to the title vector.

This is because, while talking about a subject, we may talk about a subtopic, which may not be directly linked to the original 
title but still important



*half-tested idea :  weighted addition of sentence vectors : putting weight 0.5 for new sentence vectors doesnt seem to change a
lot. have to  test with new weights

2. Cummulative Reduced Addition (untested)

While adding to the title vector i only add the past few(base = ) sentences, so that program doesnt remember sentences very far
from the current sentence
